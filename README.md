<summary><strong><em>fun facts about me</em></strong></summary>

my github profile is a meme itself  
my codes are useless.

i have no social skillz.  
no friends to playing game or talk about how fun is computer science.  
that doesn't mean i'm incel or something. 
i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
